<p>An offline, cold storage Bitcoin or crypto wallet is a major step in upgrading your cryptocurrency security.</p>

<p>Cold storage wallets keep your Bitcoins offline, and away from online computers where hackers would be able to access and steal them.</p>

<h2>Best Offline Wallets</h2>
<p>Hardware wallets are the most common form of cold storage today.</p>

<p><b>Why?</b></p>
<p>They offer the best security per dollar spent and are very good at preventing <b>you</b>, the user, from making mistakes that can lose all of your Bitcoins.</p>
<p>More bitcoins are lost due to users making mistakes than from hackers.</p>

<h2>Best Overall: Unchained</h2>

	<p class="new-desc-box">There is a reason Ledger is the largest hardware wallet manufacturer in the world. Their wallets are simple to set-up, easy to use, and have a very strong security record.

<h2>Hot Wallets vs Cold Wallet</h2>
<p>A hot Bitcoin wallet refers to any wallet that requires the internet to function properly. Hot wallets derive their name from the fact that they need electricity to work.</p>
<p>A cold wallet means your wallet is stored offline and on a device that's not connected to the internet. "Cold" is a reference to the device being offline.</p>

<h2>Types of Cold Storage - Cold Wallet Examples</h2>

<h3>1. Hardware Wallets</h3>
<p>Hardware wallets are little mini computers that store your Bitcoin offline.</p>

<h4>Why are hardware wallets <b>good</b>?</h4>
<ul class="quick-info-pros">
	<li>Easiest way to securely store bitcoins and other coins</li>
	<li>Easy to backup and secure</li>
	<li>Less margin for error; setup is easy even for less technical users</li>
	<li>Multiple hardware wallets can be used together for extra security</li>
	<li>Hardware wallets often offer a support team, which can be helpful for new users</li>
</ul>

<h4>Why are hardware wallets <b>bad</b>?</h4>
<ul class="quick-info-cons">
	<li>They're not free!</li>
	<li>They can be challenging for new users to understand</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Steel Wallets</h3>
<p>A steel wallet is a piece of nearly indestructible stainless steel that you can use to carry your bitcoin private keys or backups.</p>
<p>You do this by etching or tiling the words into the steel.</p>
<p>This makes it an excellent choice if you are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>concerned about losing paper or whatever material your seed is on</li>
	<li>live in an area with lots of flooding, fires or earthquakes</li>
</ul>
<p>Steel wallets are interesting because they can act as both a "paper wallet" or as a backup for any kind of Bitcoin wallet in case yours is lost, stolen, or destroyed.</p>
<p>Almost any crypto holder can benefit from one of these steel wallets regardless of how they choose to store their coins.</p>

<h3>3. Paper Wallets</h3>
<p>If you're concerned about malicious computer hackers getting access to your wallet, then a paper wallet is one of your best options.</p>
<center>
	<img alt="bitcoin paper wallet" src="https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/img/pages/wallets/en/steel/img/paper-wallet.jpg"/> 
	<div class="kb-helper">A very common Bitcoin paper wallet</div>
</center>
<br>

<div class="warning-box">
	<h3>WARNING</h3>
	<p>Setting up a paper wallet is for HIGHLY advanced users only. There are many ways to get a paper wallet wrong - all of which can result in a total loss of funds. Proceed at your own risk.</p>
</div>
<br>
<p>The main drawback of a paper wallet is that it's extremely prone to damage. If it's burned, your coins are gone. An upgrade to a paper wallet would to at least be to store in a fire and flood-proof safe or case.</p>
<p>Paper wallets don't have support teams like hardware wallets. If you get stuck, you'll have to figure it out on your own using the internet.</p>

<h3>4. OpenDime</h3>
<p>As the world's first bitcoin credit stick, the OpenDime device lets you spend your bitcoin balance in the same way that you would use a traditional credit card.</p>
<p>Here are some pictures I took of my old OpenDimes that I bought to test:</p>
<img src="https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/img/pages/wallets/img/opendime.jpg" />
<br>

<p>The main difference between OpenDimes and other wallets is that OpenDime only has one address. It's not a full-fledged hardware wallet that can generate and sign transactions.</p>
<br>
<img src="https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/img/pages/wallets/img/dimes.jpg" />
<br><br>
<p>The open dime is very much like a Bitcoin piggy bank.</p>
<p>You can add as much bitcoin to it as you want and as many times as you want, however you can only spend from it once.</p>
<p>At that point, the private key is exposed and the funds are no longer safe on the hardware.</p>
<p>Because of this, its best to send all the coins to a new address once you are ready to use them.</p>

<h2>Who Needs a Cold Storage Wallet?</h2>
<img alt="offline and cold bitcoin wallets" src="https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/img/newimages/offline.png">
<ul>
	<li><b>Long-Term Investors:</b> Those who buy and hold cryptocurrencies for extended periods benefit from cold wallets because they prioritize security over frequent transactions.</li>
	<li><b>High-Value Portfolio Holders:</b> People with significant cryptocurrency investments will prefer the air-gapped security offered by cold wallets to protect substantial assets.</li>
	<li><b>Privacy Advocates:</b> Users who value privacy and want full custody of their funds without third-party interference.</li>
	<li><b>Diversified Portfolio Owners:</b> Individuals owning a range of cryptocurrencies, including NFTs and various tokens, might prefer cold wallets that support multiple assets.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, active traders or those frequently engaging in crypto transactions might find cold wallets cumbersome and might prefer the convenience of hot wallets.</p>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>Is "cold storage" different than using a cold wallet?</h3>
<p>In general, "cold storage" refers to any bitcoin storage storage device that does not require an internet connection.</p>
<p>A cold storage device can be:</p>
<ul>
	<li>a physical box</li>
	<li>a piece of paper</li>
	<li>a hardware wallet</li>
	<li>a list of numbers and letters that you keep in your head</li>
</ul>

<h3>What are the differences between cold storage and a hot wallet?</h3>
<p>In contrast to hot storage, cold storage provides:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Increased security protections</li>
	<li>A reliable way to keep your bitcoin offline</li>
	<li>An easy way to transport your bitcoin between your various wallets</li>
</ul>

<h3>What happens if the offline or cold storage wallet company goes out of business?</h3>
<p>If Sony went out of business tomorrow, you would still be able to play your PlayStation with mostly no issues.</p>
<p>Offline crypto wallets are the same. You do not need a company to remain in business in order to continue using your hardware wallet.</p>
<p>Let’s say you use TREZOR with TREZOR’s myTREZOR wallet. TREZOR Wallet goes out of business and no longer supports myTREZOR wallet and it gets shut down.</p>
<p>You could, in just a few minutes, download Electrum on your computer. Once installed, you’d setup your TREZOR and all of your transaction history and balance would get imported and be exactly the same. This is because Electrum will use the same 24-word seed you generated with TREZOR or Ledger on setup.</p>

<h3>What is deep cold storage vs cold storage?</h3>
<p><b>Cold Storage</b>: Safeguarding Bitcoin by keeping its private keys offline, eliminating online hacking risks.</p>
<p><b>Deep Cold Storage</b>: An enhanced form of cold storage with added layers of protection.</p>
<p><b>Cold Storage Methods</b>:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Uses devices like paper wallets, hardware wallets, or air-gapped computers.</li>
	<li>The key is ensuring no internet connection, ever.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Deep Cold Storage Methods</b>:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Storing private keys in physical vaults.</li>
	<li>Breaking keys into multiple pieces for storage.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Cold Storage Purpose</b>: Protects Bitcoin from basic online threats.</p>
<p><b>Deep Cold Storage Purpose</b>: Provides the utmost security available, ideal for substantial Bitcoin holdings.</p>
<p>In essence, while both methods aim to secure Bitcoin, <b>deep cold storage</b> offers additional layers of safeguarding against potential threats.</p>
<p>Whether you need deep cold storage or normal cold storage will depend on your holdings.</p>

<h2>Offline Wallets We Don't Like</h2>
<p>We didn't include KeepKey on our list. While it used to be one of the more popular offline wallets, it's not being updated frequently.</p>
<p>We also did not include Ledger Stax, as it is not available to purchase yet.</p>
<p>There are also a number of hardware wallets that are not open source, so we didn't include them.</p>

<h2>Downsides of Cold and Offline Wallets</h2>
<p>There is one main downside of cold storage and offline wallets:</p>
<p><b>It can be complicated to access your funds.</b></p>
<p>Since cold storage wallets are secure, they are harder to access.</p>
<p>If you want to get your money off the wallet, it can be a time consuming task. This is really a pro, because only by adding this time can you get the extra security.</p>

<h2>Recovery Process for Cold Wallets</h2>
<p>The recovery process for cold wallets will differ depending on the type of cold
