    <h2>Koinly - Best Overall</h2>
    <br>
    <center>
        <img class="wallet-hero" src="https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/pages/info/tax/koinly-home.png" />
    </center>
    <p class="new-desc-box">Koinly is an app that makes it easy to import your data and download capital gains tax forms like the 8949, and Schedule D and export to Turbotax. The web interface is pretty simple to use and supports the US, UK, Canada, Australia, and many other countries. Check the website for supported countries</p>
    <p><b>Price range:</b> $49 to $400 per year based on features and number of crypto transactions<sup><a href="#article-sources">(1)</a></sup>.</p>
    
    <p>Koinly is the first on the list because it is, by far, the most simple crypto tax software that we have tried.</p>
    <p>Koinly does make it very simple to prepare tax forms for your crypto activity, but it doesn't do much else (unlike CoinLedger outlined below).</p>
    
    <h4>Stand-Out Features of Koinly</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Koinly syncs fast with exchanges and wallets</li>
        <li>Simple software that makes calculating taxes easy</li>
        <li>Good documentation for how to set up connections between every single exchange on the platform</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Features That Could Be Improved</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>The "free" account won't let you download tax forms, so it's not really free.</li>
        <li>No additional features beyond tax preparation</li>
        <li>The Koinly user interface can be a little bit unclear at times</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For these reasons, I might recommend Koinly for users who need very minimal features and just want their tax software to produce tax forms quickly.</p>

    <h2>CoinLedger</h2>

        <img class="wallet-hero" src="https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/pages/info/tax/cryptotax2.jpg" />
    </center> 
    <p class="new-desc-box">CoinLedger offers an easy way to calculate all your crypto taxes and has integration with TurboTax.</p>
    <p><b>Price range:</b> $49 - $299 per year based on the number of crypto transactions you made<sup><a href="#article-sources">(2)</a></sup>.</p>

    <p>CoinLedger is very simple.</p>
    <p>You'll go through a process of connecting all of your exchange accounts as well as your wallets to your CoinLedger account using API keys (don't worry, CoinLedger shows you how to do this for every single exchange). Once connected, you will import all of that data to your CoinLedger account. For US users, CoinLedger will generate Form 1040 and anything else you need.</p>
    <p>If you don't trust CoinLedger to directly connect to your accounts, you can export the data from these wallets and exchanges as Excel sheets and import those sheets into your CoinLedger account.</p>
    <p>All transactions go through 4 phases: <ol><li>Import (as explained above)</li><li>Classify</li><li>Review</li><li>Tax Reports</li></ol></p>
    
    <h4>Stand-Out Features of CoinLedger:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Incredibly helpful blog posts with written instructions and videos to supplement.</li>
        <li>Differentiates between short and long-term gains</li>
        <li>A crypto income report that helps you understand your true annual salary for that year</li>
        <li>Direct import to Turbotax, making finalizing your total taxes very easy</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Features That Could Be Improved</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Better looking and more versatile non-tax related features like portfolio performance tracking</li>
        <li>A free version of the product</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For these reasons, I recommend CoinLedger (formerly CryptoTrader.tax) to users who want to make filing their crypto taxes as painless as possible as well as bookkeeping. If you are not overly worried about granting access to your accounts to your accounting software, then CoinLedger is the software for you. I also recommend CoinLedger to anyone who is mining Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies.</p>

    <h2>Crypto Tax Calculator <span style="font-size: 16px; color: #888;">– Best for 1099-DA</span></h2>
    <br>
    <center>
        <img class="wallet-hero" src="/img/ctctax.png" alt="Crypto Tax Calculator logo" />
    </center>
    <p class="new-desc-box">Crypto Tax Calculator is a comprehensive crypto tax platform designed for investors, traders, and businesses. It makes it easy to calculate your tax to report on IRS forms like 8949, Schedule D.</p>
    <p><b>Price range:</b> $49 - $499 per year based on transaction volume.</p>

    <p>When you receive a 1099-DA from an exchange, you can use Crypto Tax Calculator to verify and correct that data to ensure accurate cost basis calculations. This helps prevent you from overpaying your tax due to missing cost basis or incorrect exchange reporting, which is a common issue with the new 1099-DA forms.</p>
    <p>Crypto Tax Calculator goes beyond tax reporting, and offers an all-in-one portfolio tracker that can identify savings opportunities through its tax loss harvesting tool. It has gained popularity with DeFi investors in particular, who praise it for its extensive support of DEXs, lending markets and complex smart contracts.</p>
    <p>Crypto Tax Calculator is an official tax partner of Coinbase and MetaMask, with support for more than 3,500 exchanges, blockchains and wallets.</p>

    <h4>Stand-Out Features of Crypto Tax Calculator:</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Unlimited currencies – Supports over 3,500 exchanges, wallets, and blockchains with unlimited currency support for any token hosted on supported blockchains</li>
        <li>Automated categorization – Uses advanced blockchain analytics to automatically classify your trades according to IRS rules</li>
        <li>1099-DA reconciliation – Can reconcile information provided by exchanges in 1099-DA forms to ensure accurate cost basis reporting</li>
        <li>30-day money-back guarantee – Much longer than other competitors who typically offer only 14 days</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Features That Could Be Improved</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Mobile app availability – Currently in testing, with a launch expected by end of 2025.</li>
        <li>Crypto payment options – Doesn't currently accept cryptocurrency as payment method</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For these reasons, I recommend Crypto Tax Calculator to investors who received a 1099-DA form this year and need to ensure its accuracy and fill in any missing information. Downloading a pre-filled 8949 and Schedule D is especially helpful, and will be valuable to users with dozens or hundreds of trades. With support for 100+ countries, it's a truly global product suited to users everywhere.</p>

      <h3>How can I avoid paying taxes on Crypto?</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      <p>Short of moving to Puerto Rico or El Salvador, if you are taking profits on crypto, there is no way to get out of paying taxes on it.</p>
      <p>That said, there are a few strategies to minimize your tax burden.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Use a Roth IRA to purchase paper crypto in bitcoin and crypto ETFs and trusts (such as Purpose Investment's BTC ETF or the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust). This allows you to use the money you've already paid taxes on to invest in Bitcoin and avoid capital gains at sale.</li>
        <li>If the year is ending and you are down on your crypto positions, sell your crypto to realize the loss and then buy back in again. This will put you in at a lower cost basis which will defer the taxes down the road should you ever make profits.</li>
        <li>Renounce your citizenship and move somewhere that doesn't tax capital gains.</li>
      </ol>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <div class="faq-question">
      <h3>What is cryptocurrency accounting software?</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      <p>Crypto tax software is pretty simple - instead of having to calculate all the taxes you owe on all your trades or crypto income, you can input your data into crypto tax software and it will generate what you owe.</p>
      <p>The software always supports Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Defi, and nearly any other coin.</p>
      <p>It will also hand that information over to your regular tax software, like TurboTax.</p>
      <p>If you make lots of trades, most crypto tax software will connect to your exchange accounts and import the data for you.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <div class="faq-question">
      <h3>How do cryptocurrency taxes work?</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      <p>If you have ever paid taxes on real estate or any other hard asset, then crypto works the same way. Any profits are taxed as capital gains.</p>
      <p>That means you pay taxes on the difference between the price you bought the coins, and the price you sell them at. This is true whether you live in Canada, the US, or the UK, as well as many other countries.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <div class="faq-question">
      <h3>Do I still pay taxes if I only made losses on my cryptocurrency?</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      <p>You must report both profits AND losses. However, if you report losses, you may be entitled to reduce your crypto taxes in the future so it's actually in your interest to report these losses.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <div class="faq-question">
      <h3>Are Crypto to Crypto Trades Taxed?</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      <p>Yes, anytime you trade one cryptocurrency for another, you are effectively selling the first currency and buying the second one.</p>
      <p>This creates either a profit or a loss for the first cryptocurrency and a new cost basis for reporting the second. Make sure to keep track of all crypto-to-crypto trades.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <div class="faq-question">
      <h3>Do I have to pay tax if I transfer crypto from wallet to wallet?</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      <p>If you do not own the second wallet, then yes, you must pay capital gains on the coins you transferred since you are effectively 'selling' them.</p>
      <p>If you own both wallets, there is no sale, and therefore there is no tax-reporting liability.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="faq-item">
    <div class="faq-question">
      <h3>Can I pay my taxes in the coins I hold?</h3>
    </div>
    <div class="faq-answer">
      <p>Even in 2024, most jurisdictions will not allow you to pay any taxes in crypto of any kind. There are a few places, such as the Swiss city of Zug<sup><a href="#article-sources">(7)</a></sup> and the US state of Ohio, among others, to allow residents to pay their taxes directly in Bitcoin. Overstock.com became the first US company to pay all of its taxes in Bitcoin<sup><a href="#article-sources">(8)</a></sup>.</p>
