  <h2>Trezor vs Bitkey: Overview</h2>
  <p>Trezor and Bitkey represent two very different approaches to Bitcoin self-custody. Trezor offers traditional hardware wallets with full user control, while Bitkey uses a unique collaborative custody model designed for simplicity.</p>

  <p><strong>Trezor</strong>, founded in 2013 by SatoshiLabs, was the first hardware wallet. Their Safe lineup features EAL6+ certified secure elements, color touchscreens, and support for 8,000+ cryptocurrencies with fully open-source hardware and software.</p>

  <p><strong>Bitkey</strong>, made by Block Inc. (formerly Square), is a Bitcoin-only device with no screen that uses fingerprint authentication and NFC. It employs a 2-of-3 multisig setup where Block holds one key for recovery assistance.</p>
