  <h2>Coldcard vs Bitkey: Overview</h2>
  <p>Coldcard and Bitkey are both Bitcoin-only hardware wallets, but they target completely different users. Coldcard is built for maximum security and control, while Bitkey prioritizes simplicity and ease of use.</p>

  <p><strong>Coldcard</strong>, made by Coinkite in Canada, is designed for advanced Bitcoiners who want complete control. It features dual secure elements, air-gapped operation via microSD/NFC/QR, a physical keypad, and advanced features like duress PINs and trick wallets.</p>

  <p><strong>Bitkey</strong>, made by Block Inc., takes the opposite approach with a minimalist design. It has no screen, uses fingerprint authentication, and employs a 2-of-3 multisig setup where Block holds one key to help with recovery if needed.</p>
