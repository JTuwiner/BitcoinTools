wallet1: Trezor Safe 7
wallet2: Ledger Flex
vssort: 9991
maindifferences:
  diff1: The Safe 7 is quantum-ready with the transparent TROPIC01 chip, while the Ledger Flex uses a CC EAL6+ certified secure chip.
  diff2: Both have large touchscreens, but the Flex uses an E Ink display that's always visible, while the Safe 7 has a vibrant LCD.
  diff3: The Safe 7 is fully open source (hardware & software), while Ledger's firmware is proprietary — a key concern for security purists.
