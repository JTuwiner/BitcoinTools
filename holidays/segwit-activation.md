## When was Segwit Lock In Day?

On August 23, 2017, Segwit officially activated on the bitcoin blockchain. 

This followed the August 9, 2017 ['Segwit' lock in](/segwit-lock-in/) and the two week grace period giving miners and users time to upgrade their software.

Once this activation occurred, miners and nodes would reject any blocks coming from miners who had not upgraded their software.

Segwit actually activated a day before expected due to some faster blocks.</div>

## Why Was Segwit Activation Day Important

Segwit Activation Day is important because it marks the end of the bitcoin block size war and the ability for bitcoin to finally scale using layer two solutions, such as [lightning network](/lightning-whitepaper/).
