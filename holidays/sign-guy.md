## Community Support

Langalis posted a Bitcoin address for donations and the Bitcoin community rallied behind his courageous act. 

As of January 2023, Langalis has [received](https://www.blockchain.com/explorer/addresses/btc/1GwtZF9QFKWNqCRHLx1Y9adGcrhQSUnNfY) over 7 BTC in donations from the Bitcoin community (currently worth over $150,000 USD).

## Why Did Bitcoin Sign Guy Get So Much Attention?

At the time, Janet Yellen was the Chair of the Federal Reserve. 

Bitcoin's main purpose is to become money, and the US dollar is seen as its biggest competitor. Since Yellen had lot of power over the dollar at the time, having a "Buy Bitcoin" sign flashed behind her was very creative and unexpected.
