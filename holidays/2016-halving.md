## What Happened Before the 2016 Halving? 

Between November 28, 2012 (the previous halving date before the one in 2016) to February 6th, 2014, [Bitcoin went from $12 to around $900](/price/), before beginning a swift descent down to nearly $100 by February 21, 2014.

## What Happened After the 2016 Halving?

And that is more or less what happened after the 2016 halving. 

From July 2016 to January 2017, Bitcoin rose in price by about 60%, from the 600s to over $1,000.

## Predictions for 2024 Halving

The 2024 halving will likely create tons of media hype and interest in Bitcoin. 

We've seen price predictions from Chase Bank analysts as high as $120,000 and even Adam Back, CEO of Blockstream make bets that Bitcoin will reach at least $100k.
