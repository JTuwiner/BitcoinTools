## Predictions for 2024 Halving

The 2024 halving will likely create tons of media hype and interest in Bitcoin. 

We've seen halving price predictions from Chase bank analysts as high as $120,000 and even Adam Back, CEO of Blockstream make bets that Bitcoin will reach at least $100k. 

The 2024 halving is important because it is the year Bitcoin's inflation rate will finally go below gold, making it the scarcest money to ever exist.
