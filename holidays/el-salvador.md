On June 9, 2021, the Legislative Assembly of El Salvador approved a bill that made bitcoin an official currency of the nation along side the US dollar, which has been the national currency up until this point and since 2001.

The idea was put forth by President Nayib Bukele and was eagerly voted in by the legislative assembly.

The law was very simple. Anything a Salvadorian could do with US dollars could now be done with bitcoin. 

* Vendors would be forced to accept it.
* Citizens could pay their taxes with it.
* Citizens could use it to remit money in and out of El Salvador. 

Like all policies, there was both excitement and skepticism surrounding the decision. 

Supporters stated that it may increase financial inclusion for the unbanked and facilitate remittances to and from El Salvador. 

Opponents worried that because of bitcoin's volatile price, many Salvadorians who put their savings into bitcoin might be harmed in a negative price movement. 

Despite these reservations, El Salvador went ahead with its proposal to become the first nation in the world to accept bitcoin as legal tender. 

The law went into effect on September 7, 2021, and to promote bitcoins usage, the government introduced a digital wallet named Chivo wherein every citizen could claim $30 of bitcoin.

The law's implementation hasn't been without problems, though, including [technical difficulties](https://www.independent.co.uk/tech/bitcoin-el-salvador-chivo-wallet-b1915627.html){: target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" } with the state-funded bitcoin wallet *Chivo*.

The passing and enactment of the law also sparked minor protests from certain Salvadorian groups.
