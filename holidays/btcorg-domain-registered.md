On August 8, 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto first purchased the domain name bitcoin.org. 

Satoshi used anonymousspeech.com to register the domain, and it remains unclear how he paid anonymously for the domain.

## Leaving Bitcoin

When Satoshi stopped working on Bitcoin in 2011, he transferred control of bitcoin.org to a new group of owners, according to [Bitcoin.org's website](https://bitcoin.org/en/posts/ten-year-anniversary):

> When Satoshi left the project, he gave ownership of the domain to additional people, separate from the Bitcoin developers, to spread responsibility and prevent any one person or group from easily gaining control over the Bitcoin project.
