## Satoshi Nakamoto's Birthday

Bitcoin inventor Satoshi Nakamoto registered his birthday as April 5th, 1975 on his P2P Foundation profile.

It is hard to be sure if this is his actual birthday or one he made up, though given his clear preference for privacy, it seems unlikely this is actual his birth date or birth year.

## Important Events In Satoshi's Lifetime

Below I have put together a list of important events that may have shaped Satoshi's life and influenced him to create bitcoin. 

I have tried to spread it out over different ages of his life.

Of course, if Satoshi was being dishonest about his birthday, we may be missing some important events (if he's older than he says) or adding events he missed (if he is younger than he says).

## Conclusion

Again, its difficult to know Satoshi's actual birthday, but if his stated date is to be believed, then these events are just some of the many important he would have witnessed and that almost certainly played a role in his creation of bitcoin.
