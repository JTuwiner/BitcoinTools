<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>Is Blockstream's Aqua Available on Android?</h3>

<p>Blockstream's simple single-sig wallet called Aqua is now available on Android.</p>

<h4>What is Aqua?</h4>

<p>Aqua is a single-signature mobile-only wallet, meaning anyone with access to your phone (either physically or remotely) could steal your coins. In exchange for the increased risk, the wallet is easier to use.</p>

<p>Aqua is new, and if you have an Android device, it can be a great addition to Blockstream Green Desktop.</p>

<h3>What is Guarda Wallet?</h3>

<p>Guarda Wallet is a software wallet that was launched in 2017 with support for Ethereum (ETH). It is available on Android. We do not recommend it as it does not support hardware wallets.</p>

<h3>Is Electrum supported on Android?</h3>

<p>Electrum wallet is one of the most trusted crypto wallets which stores only Bitcoin. With Electrum release 4.2.1, Android (5.0 and higher) is supported. Note: While Electrum is available on Google Play, make sure to verify the installation of the distributed files using GPG signatures explained on their website. This ensures that the files have not been compromised.</p>

<h3>Is BitPay supported on Android?</h3>

<p>Yes, BitPay is available on the Google Play Store. We do not recommend it as it does not support hardware wallets and is custodial, meaning you do not hold your coins. BitPay does.</p>

<h3>Which wallet is best for investors?</h3>

<p>Investors should use an offline or cold wallet, not an Android wallet alone. Android wallets on their own are not very secure, so anyone holding large sums of money in crypto is advised not to use Android wallets without a hardware wallet connected.</p>

<h3>What is Exodus wallet?</h3>

<p>Exodus is a wallet that supports over a hundred cryptocurrencies. In the beginning, Exodus was originally available only on desktop (Windows, Mac, or Linux), but is now also available for iOS and Android mobile platforms as well. You can also connect it to the Trezor Model T or Trezor One hardware wallets.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>There are probably hundreds of Bitcoin wallets on the Google Play Store.</p>
<p>Most of them are bad.</p>
<p>To find the best wallet for you, figure out what aspects are important to you, and choose a wallet that excels in that category.</p>
<p>If you stick to one of the wallets listed above, you should have a good experience.</p>
<p>And if you want to take security to the next level, we recommend looking into <a href="/categories/hardwarewallets.html">hardware wallets</a>, like the Ledger Nano X.</p>
