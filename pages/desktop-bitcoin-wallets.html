        <p>Now that you have chosen a wallet, let's transfer some funds into it.</p>
        <p>In this brief walkthrough, we will show you how to add funds to your desktop wallet</p> 
    </div>
</div>
<br>

<p>For you to add funds to your desktop wallet, you will need to buy some cryptocurrency from an exchange and transfer it to your desktop wallet. Most desktop wallets do not have exchanges native to it.</p>

<p>You'll need to choose an exchange that services your country and/or state. The best place to do that is to go to our <a href="/">exchange finder</a>.</p>

<p>After you have bought your crypto, you'll need to send it to your wallet. To do that, do the following:</p>

<h4>1. Open your wallet and find an option to "receive"</h4>

<center>
    <img style="max-width:40%" src="https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/pages/wallets/en/img/receive-funds.png" />
</center> 
<br />

<h4>2. Copy the address given</h4>

<center>
    <img style="max-width:40%" src="https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/pages/wallets/en/img/crypto-address.png" />
</center> 
<br />

<h4>3. On your exchange where you bought your coins, select the "send" option.</h4>

<center>
    <img alt="coinbase home page" src="https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/pages/wallets/en/img/send.jpg" />
</center> 
<br />

<p>Above screenshot is from Coinbase.</p>

<h4>4. There should be a field to input your wallet address copied in step 2. Paste it there.</h4>

<center>
    <img alt="coinbase input address" src="https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/pages/wallets/en/img/input-address.png" />
</center> 
<br />

<h4>5. Confirm you want to send your coins.</h4>

<p>After that, you should receive a confirmation with a transaction ID of some kind. Here is what that might look like.</p>

        <p>With funds in your desktop wallet, its time to take your security to the next level.</p>
        <p>The best way to do that is with a hardware wallet like a <a href="https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/wallets/ledger-nano-x/">ledger</a> or <a href="https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/wallets/trezor-t/">Trezor</a></p> 
    </div>

<p>Desktop wallets have the advantage of being free and easy to use. However, using a desktop wallet also poses many dangers to your coins.</p>

<p>Making sure your coins are not stolen through malware or ransomware is difficult to avoid on a desktop wallet.</p>

<div class="kb-helper">Malware and Ransomware on your computer can result in stolen coins</div>
</center>

<p>This is where hardware wallets come in. Hardware wallets are never connected to the internet. They store the private keys and sign transactions you send to them. You verify the transaction on the screen of the hardware wallet, and hand off the signed transaction back to interface on your desktop or mobile phone.</p>

<p>Hardware wallets are a great way, then, to keep your coins safe if you want to use a desktop wallet. Instead of housing the coins on the desktop computer, you store them on the hardware wallet and the desktop just acts as your UI to control the hardware wallet.</p>

        <br>
        <p>Now that we've got our desktop wallet set up with a hardware wallet, let's explore a few additional points on security.</p>
        <p>PINs, VPNs, and <a href="https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/wallets/steel/">Steel wallets</a> are great additions to our security stack.</p> 
    </div>
    <br>
</div>
<br>

<h3>Always set up a PIN to protect your funds</h3>

<p>Make sure your desktop wallet is protected by a 4 to 6 digit PIN number. Much like your bank account, most wallets have a PIN password that is the absolute minimum when it comes to protecting funds you keep on your wallet. This prevents someone who has your phone from accessing the coins and sending them to another wallet that they own.</p>

<center>
<img alt="hardware wallet pin number" src="https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/pages/wallets/img/pin.png" />
<div class="kb-helper">Setting up a PIN is a minimal requirement when it comes to mobile wallet security.</div>
</center>

<p>A PIN is not very strong security, but it's good enough to prevent most people who have temporary access to your unlocked phone from taking your money.</p>

<h3 id="store-your-recovery-phrase-on-something-that-is-water-and-fire-proof">Store your recovery phrase on something that is water and fire proof</h3>

<p>All the desktop wallets on this list support BIP39 seed words, otherwise known as 'recovery phrases'. If your phone is lost, destroyed, or stolen, you can use this phrase to recover your funds to a new device.</p>

<p>However, most people write down these words on a piece of paper. When their home catches fire or is flooded, they lose the device and the backup to the elements. You should therefore consider a steel backup device like the <a href="https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/wallets/billfodl-review/">PrivacyPros Billfodl</a>.</p>

<div class="kb-helper">The Billfodl protects your funds from fire and flood.</div>
</center>
 
<h3>DO NOT store a lot of coins on your desktop wallet</h3>

<p>We've mentioned this before, but its worth repeating: you should treat your desktop wallet the same way you treat your real world wallet. You wouldn't carry every dollar you own in your pocket. You should also not hold all your coins on your desktop wallet. You need to store them on a hardware wallet.</p>

<h3>Which Countries Do Desktop Wallets Support?</h3>

<p>Desktop wallets are just software so they work in any country.</p>

<h3>Use a VPN when transacting on an desktop wallet</h3>

<center>
<img alt="man holding mobile phone with vpn running" src="https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/pages/wallets/img/vpn.jpg" />
<div class="kb-helper">A VPN shields your IP address from leaking.</div>
</center>

<p>When making Bitcoin transactions on your desktop wallet, it is a good practice to use a VPN. This prevents your ISP or hackers listening in on your connection from tying your IP address (and therefore your personal identity) to your Bitcoin transactions. It's a good privacy practice that is cheap and easy to implement.</p>

        <p>Below are some of our most asked questions by readers.</p>
        <p>If you're wondering about a topic on this page, odds are we have the answer here.</p> 
    </div>
</div>
<br>

<img class="halfimg-left-sm" src="https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/pages/wallets/img/desktop.png" alt="desktop icon" />
<h3><b>When should I use a desktop Bitcoin wallet?</b></h3>

<p>If you're on your computer a lot and don't need super secure storage, a desktop wallet is a good choice.</p>

<img class="halfimg-left-sm" src="https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/pages/wallets/img/hardware.png" alt="hardware wallet icon" />
<h3><b>Do desktop wallets work with hardware wallets?</b></h3>

<p>Yes, many desktop wallets allow the user to utilize a hardware wallet as the signer of transactions. This means that the private key is not help on the computer the desktop wallet is installed on.</p>

<p>Instead, the private key is held on a hardware wallet, and the desktop wallet is used as an interface for the hardware wallet. The desktop wallets sends transaction data to the hardware wallet to sign off on. If you've ever used Ledger Live, this is essentially how it works as well.</p>

<img class="halfimg-left-sm" src="https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/pages/wallets/img/large-amounts.png" alt="safe icon" />
<h3><b>Can I store large amounts of bitcoins in a desktop wallet?</b></h3>

<p>You can, but this isn't recommended.</p>

<p>If you want to use a desktop wallet but need to store large amounts of Bitcoin, its best to utilize a hardware wallet to sign transactions for the desktop wallet (as mentioned above).</p>

<p>KeepKey, TREZOR, and Ledger Nano X all work with Electrum. TREZOR One and Model T and the Ledger Nano S and X all work with Copay.</p>

<h3><b>What's the difference between a desktop wallet and a web wallet?</b></h3>

<p>Web wallets are more like accounts. A web wallet makes you set a passwords which it uses to encrypt your wallet on the web wallet server.</p>

<p>Desktop wallets are actual apps that are installed on your computer.</p>

<h3><b>If someone has access to my computer can they access my bitcoins?</b></h3>

<p>It depends. Many desktop wallets encrypt your private keys and request a password to decrypt it every time you open the wallet. This means that you need to enter a password in order to send bitcoins from most desktop wallets.</p>

<h3><b>How do I backup my desktop wallet?</b></h3>

<p>Most wallets generate a seed on setup. You write this seed down on a piece of paper and it can be used to restore your wallet if you lose your computer of have it stolen.</p>

<h3><b>Can I use more than one desktop wallet at a time?</b></h3>

<h3><b>What is the difference between Blockstream Green and Aqua?</b></h3>

<p>While both of these Bitcoin and Liquid wallets are made by Blockstream, only Blockstream Green is available for desktop. Aqua is only available as a mobile wallet on IOS (Android version available late 2021). The other difference is that Blockstream green uses a 2-of-2 multisig to protect your coins from hackers. Aqua is a single signature wallet, meaning anyone with access to your phone (either physically or remotely) could steal your coins. In exchange for the increased risk, the wallet is easier to use.</p>

<p>Aqua is new, and if you have an iOS device, it can be a great addition to Blockstream Green Desktop.</p>

<h3><b>Does Blockstream Jade work with Blockstream Green Desktop?</b></h3>

<p>Yes, you can now use the Blockstream Green app on your desktop to set up your wallet on your Blockstream Jade hardware wallet!</p>
