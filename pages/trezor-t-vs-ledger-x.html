<p>For a while, the <a href="https://affil.trezor.io/SHf4" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">TREZOR One</a> was the only hardware wallet. Then, Ledger launched the Ledger Nano S.</p>

<p>Now, both companies have newer devices: the <a href="https://ledger.pxf.io/MAmEDJ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Ledger Nano X</a> and TREZOR Model T.</p>

<p>Competition has lowered prices, but it makes choosing the right hardware wallet a tough decision.</p>

<div class="takeaways">
  <ul>
    <li>The TREZOR T having a color touch screen is the main difference between these two wallets.</li>

<p>In this guide, we will see how Ledger Nano X and TREZOR fare in many areas like security, coin support, setup, and user experience.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<h3><a href="https://ledger.pxf.io/MAmEDJ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Ledger Nano X</a></h3>

<img src="https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/wallets/img/ledger-x-box.png" alt="ledger nano x">

<p>The Ledger Nano X is Ledger's main hardware wallet, but not its newest. It's newest is the <a href="https://ledger.pxf.io/3eNvLk">Ledger Stax</a>.</p>

<p>The main benefit is that it has Bluetooth, making it the first hardware wallet that connects with iOS devices.</p>

<p>It's more secure than using just an app on your phone because all transactions are signed with the Nano X.</p>

<p>It's very easy to set up and use.</p>

<h3>TREZOR Model T</h3>

<img src="https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/wallets/img/trezor-t-box.png" alt="trezor t box contents">

<p>The TREZOR Model T is a second-generation Bitcoin/crypto hardware wallet manufactured by SatoshiLabs.</p>

<p>The TREZOR line debuted in 2014 with the TREZOR One and has remained one of the most popular Bitcoin cold storage solutions to date.</p>

<h2>Screen</h2>

<p>A screen is a really important security feature for hardware wallets. If you don't have a screen on a hardware wallet, it is COMPLETELY USELESS.</p>

<p>The screen lets you back up the recovery phrase without exposing it on a computer. It also allows you to review the addresses and amounts before confirming an outgoing transaction.</p>

<p><strong>Both devices DO have a screen.</strong></p>

<p>The TREZOR T has a 240x240 pixels color LCD screen. Ledger Nano X has a 128x64 LCD screen.</p>

<p>The main difference is that TREZOR T has a touch screen while the Nano X's screen is not touch.</p>

<p>In my testing, I found issues with the TREZOR T screen where it was hard for me to click areas of the screen. Certain areas of the screen were unresponsive for me.</p>

<div style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 32px; margin-top: 30px;">Ledger Nano X Screen</div>

<img src="https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/wallets/img/nano-x-screen.jpg" alt="ledger nano x">

<p>The Ledger Nano X features the smallest and lowest resolution screen of the 3 hardware wallets. Of course, you don't need a very large screen to use a hardware wallet, but generally bigger is better.</p>

<p>One problem we observed with the Nano X screen is its low resolution, making m's look like r's and n's put together - see "m" vs "rn". This makes it more difficult to verify addresses (as mentioned above). That may be worth the additional $40, but for many, it won't be.</p>

<div style="font-weight: 700; font-size: 32px; margin-top: 30px;">Trezor Model T Screen</div>

<img src="https://buybitcoinworldwide.com/wallets/img/trezor-t-screen.jpg" alt="trezor model t full-color touch screen">

<p>The Model T's full-color touch screen makes it the easiest hardware wallet to navigate and the easiest to use when verifying addresses.</p>

<p>Ledger is planning to release the Ledger Stax wallet soon, which features a full-color touch screen.</p>

<h2>Supported Coins</h2>

<p>The Ledger Nano X supports the most coins. The TREZOR T also supports a good amount of coins.</p>

<p>Both Ledger Nano X and Trezor T support all ERC20 tokens.</p>

<p>Here are the supported coins out of the top 20 largest cryptocurrencies:</p>

<h2>Price</h2>

<p>The Ledger Nano X will run you $149, while the Trezor T will run you $219 USD or 219 Euro. The reason for the higher Trezor T price is due to the full-color touch screen.</p>

<center>
<img alt="trezor screen" src="/wallets/img/trezor-screen.jpeg" />
<div class="kb-helper">Trezor T's full color touch screen.</div>
</center>

<p>Not only is it much easier to navigate than the Ledger Nano X, but also potentially less likely to result in a user error.</p>

<h2>Size &amp; Design</h2>

<p>Each wallet does have some unique differences that are hard to see in the picture.</p>

<p>The Ledger Nano X has two physical buttons, while the Trezor Model T has a touch screen.</p>

<h2>Security</h2>

<p>The Trezor and Ledger devices are a very safe way to store your cryptocurrencies.</p>

<p>Still, there are some important differences between the devices. The main difference is the Ledger Nano X is based on a dual-chip architecture featuring a secure element.</p>

<p>The Trezor Model T does not have a secure element because (they claim) there are no open-source secure elements available on the market.</p>

<p>You can see the importance of open-source software to Trezor. Trezor has even open-sourced its own software and hardware so you could (if you wanted to) make your own Trezor T on your own if you bought the parts.</p>

<p>This also means there are many eyes on both the hardware and the software.</p>

<p>Ledger Nano X does not open-source any part of their software or hardware.</p>

<p>Another feature offered by Trezor T is its support for Shamir's Secret Sharing, which is a way to split up your private key into multiple parts and spread them out, decreasing the chance of catastrophic loss.</p>

<p>Both devices have screens which means you don't need to expose the recovery phrase to your computer.</p>

<h3>Multisig Compatibility</h3>

<p>The Trezor and Ledger devices are compatible with most multi-sig software, such as Specter and Caravan.</p>

   <div class="kb-helper">The UI of Specter's open-source multi-sig software. You can use Trezor or Ledger wallets with Specter.</div>
</center>

<h2>Software Compatibility</h2>

<p>To use any hardware wallet you need software that helps you command and interact with the wallet.</p>

<p>The table below shows the compatibility of Bitcoin wallet software with each hardware wallet.</p>

<h2>Which wallets support Full Nodes?</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, only Ledger offers full node support on their native software. For the others, you will need to turn to 3rd party wallet software like <a href="https://electrum.org/#home" target="_blank">Electrum</a> if you want to get the most out of your <a href="/glossary/full-node/">full node</a> with your hardware wallet.</p>

<p>Both wallets support integrations with Electrum or Electrum Server. You can find documentation on setting that up for each wallet below:</p>

<ul>
<li>Trezor</li>
<li>Ledger</li>
</ul>

<p>Ledger recently announced that full node support is now live through its <a href="https://github.com/ledgerhq/satstack/releases">Satstack software</a>. However, you will need to be able to use a command line interface for now.</p>

<h2>Do They Support Segwit?</h2>

<p>Yes, all three wallets support <a href="https://glossary.bitbo.io/segwit/">Segwit</a> addresses.</p>

<p>The main benefit of Segwit is lower fees when sending Bitcoins.</p>

<h2>Which is Best?</h2>

<p>We wouldn't say there is a "best".</p>

<p>You need to decide what is more important to you:</p>

<p>Bluetooth capability or an easy-to-navigate touch screen.</p>

<p>If you are always on the go and make lots of trades, the Nano X is the better option because you can connect it to your phone and easily make trades. You can also easily send crypto while you are out and about.</p>

<p>If you want the easiest-to-use hardware wallet and won't be sending or trading lots of tokens, the Trezor Model T is the better option. The touchscreen on the Model T makes it much simpler to navigate than the two-button navigation system on Ledger Nano X.</p>

<h2>Methodology</h2>

<p>I bought both the Ledger Nano X and TREZOR T and tested both of them. We also researched facts about each wallet like price, screen, and more to compare the wallets. We also included unique experiences we had with each wallet.</p>
