<p>This backup is usually 12 or 24 words.</p>

<div class="kb-helper">What a backup seed phrase looks like.</div>
</center>
<p>If TREZOR, Ledger, Coldcard or any other wallet or hardware wallet company go out of business, you can use any other wallet to recover your wallet.</p>
<p>The 12 or 24 words you wrote down at the beginning when you got your wallet can re-create your wallet without the need for the hardware wallet company you bought from.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>You bought a Ledger wallet and wrote down the 24 word backup.</p>
<p>Ledger closed and for some reason their software no longer works.</p>
<p>You can easily download dozens of other wallets and have instant access to your money.</p>
<p>You'll just import the 24 words and the other wallet software will re-create your wallet again.</p>

<h2 id="what-happens-if-any-other-crypto-wallet-goes-out-of-business">What Happens if Any Other Crypto Wallet Goes out of Business?</h2>

<p>The same process explained above applies to any other crypto wallet. This assumes the wallet offers a 12 or 24 word backup phrase at the beginning.</p>
<p>If your wallet did not offer that, it's likely that they control your coins and not you.</p>

<h2 id="what-happens-if-you-lose-your-hardware-wallet">What Happens if You Lose Your Hardware Wallet?</h2>

<p>If you lose your wallet, you'll need to recover it using the 12 or 24 words you acquired when you set it up.</p>

<h2 id="best-ways-to-store-your-seed-phrase-backup">Best Ways to Store Your Seed Phrase Backup</h2>

<p>The most secure way to <a href="https://bitbo.io/tools/steel-wallets/">store your wallet seed phrase is on a metal or steel wallet</a>.</p>
<p>If you store your seed on paper, it's much easier for it to get destroyed by fire, water or other causes.</p>
