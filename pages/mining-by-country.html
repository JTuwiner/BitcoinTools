<ul>
  <li>The United States does 38% of all mining - more than any other country.</li>
  <li>China once had the most mining until the government banned it in 2021.</li>
  <li>The top three countries do 78% of all Bitcoin mining.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>China was the undisputed world leader in Bitcoin mining until July 2021, when the Chinese government banned all mining operations in the country.</p>
<p>Chinese <a href="https://bitbo.io/glossary/mining-pool/">mining pools</a> had control of more than 60% of the Bitcoin network's collective hash rate.</p>
<p>Despite the ban, China still has the second or third-highest share of Bitcoin mining globally.</p>

<h2 id="estimated-hash-power-by-country">Estimated Hash Power by Country</h2>

<p>Here was the estimated mining hash power breakdown by country in 2022 according to the University of Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance:</p>

<p>Other interesting stats are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The UK has a very small share of mining (0.1%)</li>
  <li>The EU countries only own about 6% of all mining hash rate</li>
</ul>

<p>The stats above are accurate as of September 2023.</p>
<p>As you can see, China was dominating Bitcoin mining by a <em>very wide</em> margin, but now that dominance has shifted to the USA.</p>

<h3 id="update-june-2021-china-cracks-down-on-mining">UPDATE June 2021: China Cracks Down On Mining</h3>

<p>In what is being called “The Great Mining Migration”, large mining operations based in China are fleeing the country.</p>
<p>That's because of a <a href="https://www.gov.cn/xinwen/2021-05/21/content_5610192.htm" target="_blank">memo</a> from the Financial Stability and Development Committee of the State Council of the Chinese Communist Party.</p>
<p>While the memo is in Chinese, Google Translate gives us a good picture of what it says:</p>

<blockquote style="padding-left: 30px;"><em>A prudent monetary policy must be flexible, precise, reasonable, and appropriate...The second [goal] is to resolutely prevent and control financial risks...[by cracking] down on Bitcoin mining and trading behavior, and [to] resolutely prevent the transmission of individual risks to the social field.</em></blockquote>
<div class="quote-ref">- Financial Committee <span class="position">CCP<br><br></span></div>

<p>That night, all mining farms were instructed to shut down permanently.</p>
<br>

<br>
<p>This DOES NOT mean this hashing power is going offline forever. It just means the miners need to move their operations to other countries.</p>
<p>And most of them seem to be opting for Texas, due to its <a href="https://www.texasmonthly.com/news-politics/bitcoin-cryptocurrency-texas-blockchain-leader/" target="_blank">crypto-friendly</a> regulatory environment, low taxes, and wealth of cheap energy (20% of which is fueled by renewable wind).</p>
<p>This migration marks the first major shift in Bitcoin's mining history and will no doubt have major implications for Bitcoin going forward.</p>
