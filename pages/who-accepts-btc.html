<p>Starbucks initially disappointed the Bitcoin world when it was prematurely reported that Starbucks would begin accepting Bitcoin payments directly in stores in 2019. However, Starbucks later clarified that the reports were wrong on a couple of fronts. First, they would not be accepting Bitcoin payments directly.

<h2 id="gift-card-services">Gift Card Services</h2>

<p>Many stores have yet to add support for Bitcoin directly, which is why a few services have stepped in to fill in the gap while we wait for wider adoption.

<p>As an organization who's sole purpose is to leak state secrets, such as Edward Snowden's revelations about PRISM and the NSA's spying on its own citizens, its no wonder that all of Wikileaks traditional banking was shut down, forcing him to lean on Bitcoin.</p>
<p>Julian Assange even mentioned how he made 50,000% return on Bitcoin thanks to the US government.</p>
