<p>Starbucks initially disappointed the Bitcoin world when it was prematurely reported that Starbucks would begin accepting Bitcoin payments directly in stores in 2019. However, Starbucks later clarified that the reports were wrong on a couple of fronts. First, they would not be accepting Bitcoin payments directly. Instead, they would be partnering with future's exchange Bakkt and second, no Bitcoin payments would be accepted until mid-2020 when the Bakkt app launches</p>
<p>Thankfully that app has finally launched, which means you can make Bitcoin payments in Starbucks right now!</p>

<h2 id="gift-card-services">Gift Card Services</h2>

<p>Many stores have yet to add support for Bitcoin directly, which is why a few services have stepped in to fill in the gap while we wait for wider adoption.
