Trading and investing in cryptocurrencies (also called digital or virtual currencies, crypto assets, altcoins, etc.), initial coin offerings, commodity futures, and equities involves a substantial risk of loss and is not suitable for every investor. There can be no guarantees of profit nor of avoiding losses. The valuation of cryptocurrencies and futures may fluctuate, and as a result, investors may lose more than their original investment.
</p>
<p>
Should you engage in using leverage or margin, you understand that leverage will result in proportionately greater gains AND losses. The highly leveraged nature of futures trading means that small market movements will have a great impact on your trading account and this can work against you, leading to large losses or can work for you, leading to large gains. You understand and acknowledge the real possibility that you could lose all your invested funds and be required to deposit additional funds to maintain or close your position. If the market moves against you, you may sustain a total loss greater than the amount you deposited into your account. You are responsible for all the risks and financial resources you use and for the chosen trading system. You should not engage in trading unless you fully understand the nature of the transactions you are entering into and the extent of your exposure to loss. If you do not fully understand these risks you must seek independent advice from your financial advisor.
